# AHKM

A mod for the game Hollow Knight where everyone can make any addition as long as the mod still compiles.
i.e

- Changes to readme / workflows / csproj do not count
- Do not remove any lines of code (formatting is okay, but keep it reasonable)
- Any change must compile and the game still be playable with the mod loaded in the game
- You can commit again once atleast 5 other people have committed
- Merge conflicts must be resolved keeping the spirit of the previous change (or get the author of the conflicting code to agree)

:chaosknight: good luck
